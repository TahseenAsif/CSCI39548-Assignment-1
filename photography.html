    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <p>Occasionally I like to take photos. I shoot with a Canon M50 and my favorite kinds of photos to shoot are portraits
        because I like seeing people react to having their picture taken, which is usually happy. Though I don't feel comfortable
        taking pictures of random people, so I mostly take pictures of just whatever I find interesting. I might enjoy landscape
        pictures if I went out of the city more
