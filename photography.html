    <h1>Photography</h1>
    <h2>Main Camera: Canon M50</h2>
    <h3>Lenses: 50mm f/1.8, 22mm f/2.0</h3>
    <p>Occasionally I like to take photos. I shoot with a Canon M50 and my favorite kinds of photos to shoot are portraits
        because I like seeing people react to having their picture taken, which is usually happy. Though I don't feel comfortable
        taking pictures of random people, so I mostly take pictures of just whatever I find interesting. I might enjoy landscape
        pictures if I went out of the city more
