    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <p>I've been playing guitar for just about 5 years now. I pretty much only play fingerstyle which does not use a pick and exclusively
        uses my fingers, and I mostly play acoustic guitar. I have occasionally tried electric guitar but not very often since my electric
        guitar is not very good, though I am planning to buy a new one. Below is a list of some songs I've learned, each given a rank of
        how hard I percieved them to be while learning them
